Frontend-mentor-Qr Challenge :

This challenge is to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible given in the Frontend Mentor website. This challenge is for absolute beginners to learn HTML and CSS. With this challenge, you will learn about some basic stuff like how to center a div, how to change font, text color, background color, etc.
The picture given below is a preview of what I have created.
